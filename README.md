# Logic Pro X - templates for Battery 4 drum kits

This is my collection of step sequencer templates. I'm using Battery 4 from Native Instruments, and was looking for an easy way to get patterns pushed to the kits. So I loaded the kit, added all the notes, and painstakingly mapped each note to the right one in the kit, adding its name. Saved, and pushed to Github ! 

The name of the template matches the Battery 4 unmodified kit (for instance, the "808 Detailed kit template" is the Step Sequencer pattern for the Battery 4 "808 Detailed kit", with its 60 samples.
